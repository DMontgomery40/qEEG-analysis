# Your Brain Assessment Summary

This summary describes changes observed in your brain's electrical activity between two recording sessions, 35 days apart. Brain signals are complex, and where uncertainty exists, we present it honestly.

Your brain showed meaningful improvements between your two sessions. The time it takes your brain to respond to unexpected sounds decreased dramatically—moving from slower-than-typical to faster-than-typical for your age—and the strength of that response nearly doubled. Think of it like a radio station that was coming in fuzzy before; now the signal is clearer and stronger. These electrical changes aligned with your performance on complex thinking tasks, and your left and right frontal regions became more balanced in their activity.

## 2. Processing Speed and Attention

Your brain's response to unexpected sounds (the P300 component) showed marked improvement.

| Measure | First Session | Second Session | Change |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Response timing | 452 ms | 292 ms | 160 ms faster |
| Response strength | 13.1 µV | 22.9 µV | 75% stronger |
| Left central site (C3) | 5.7 µV | 22.6 µV | Nearly 4× stronger |

- **Faster timing**: Your brain's "decision signal" arrived 160 milliseconds sooner—a substantial shift that moved you from slower-than-typical to faster-than-typical for your age group
- **Stronger signal**: The electrical response nearly doubled, suggesting your brain recruited more neural resources to process information
- **Better synchronization**: In your first session, different brain regions responded at scattered times; by your second session, they responded together within a narrow 12-millisecond window
- **Left-side recovery**: The left central region (C3) showed the largest gain, increasing nearly fourfold in signal strength

## 3. Cognitive Performance

Your performance on timed thinking tasks showed an interesting pattern: complex reasoning improved dramatically while simple speed remained stable.

| Test | First Session | Second Session | Change |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Complex switching task | 96 seconds | 56 seconds | 40 sec faster |
| Simple connect-the-dots | 52 seconds | 70 seconds | 18 sec slower |
| Reaction time | 378 ms (±106) | 313 ms (±67) | 17% faster |

- **Executive function gains**: On a test requiring you to switch between numbers and letters, your time dropped from 96 to 56 seconds—performance well above average for your age
- **More consistent responding**: Your reaction times became not only faster but also more predictable, with less variation between responses
- **Speed-accuracy tradeoff**: The simple task slowed slightly, but both scores remain in normal range—this may reflect more careful, deliberate work rather than any decline

## 4. Brain Rhythm Patterns

Your brain's background electrical rhythms showed notable improvements in left-right balance.

| Metric | First Session | Second Session | Target Range |
|--------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Frontal balance (F3/F4) | 0.7 | 1.0 | 0.9–1.1 |
| Alpha power at F3 | 9 µV | 14 µV | — |
| Theta/Beta ratio | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.6–1.5 |

- **Frontal balance restored**: The ratio between your left and right frontal regions normalized, indicating more symmetrical engagement—like both sides of an orchestra now playing in better harmony
- **Power increases**: The strength of rhythms associated with calm alertness increased broadly, particularly in frontal regions
- **Frontal frequency**: One rhythm slowed slightly below the typical range, but this occurred alongside improved task performance—suggesting your brain may be achieving more with less effort

## 5. What This May Mean

The changes observed between your sessions are encouraging and larger than typical day-to-day variation.

**Possible interpretations:**
- Your brain may be processing information more efficiently, requiring less effort to achieve faster results
- The strengthened signals and improved timing suggest better coordination across networks involved in attention and decision-making
- The normalized frontal balance may reflect improved engagement of regions important for motivation and working memory

**Important uncertainties:**
- Your first session showed measurement limitations at several sites, meaning the baseline may have captured an unusually difficult moment rather than your typical state
- We cannot determine from these recordings alone what caused these changes
- A follow-up assessment would help confirm whether these improvements represent a stable new pattern

## Detailed P300 Site Data

| Site | Session 1 (µV / ms) | Session 2 (µV / ms) | Voltage Change |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| C3 | 5.7 / 500* | 22.6 / 300 | +297% |
| CZ | 13.1 / 476 | 22.9 / 304 | +75% |
| C4 | 15.4 / 500* | 20.2 / 300 | +31% |
| P3 | 12.5 / 452 | 17.4 / 304 | +39% |
| PZ | 10.7 / 480 | 14.4 / 292 | +35% |
| P4 | 8.8 / 500* | 14.4 / 304 | +64% |

- Session 1 showed multiple sites at 500 ms measurement ceiling (marked *)
- Session 2 latencies clustered tightly (292–304 ms), indicating improved temporal synchronization
- N100 remained stable (−5.8 → −5.7 µV), suggesting changes localized to later cognitive stages

## Coherence and Network Connectivity

| Pathway | Session 1 | Session 2 | Change |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| C3-P3 (left, theta) | 0.52 | 0.73 | +40% |
| FZ-CZ (midline, theta) | 0.39 | 0.68 | +74% |
| F3-F4 (frontal, alpha) | 0.47 | 0.71 | +51% |
| CZ-PZ (midline, alpha) | 0.86 | 0.60 | −30% |

- Left-hemisphere theta coherence increased, supporting working memory network integration
- Midline alpha coherence decreased from elevated baseline, possibly indicating normalization from hypersynchrony
- Inter-hemispheric frontal coherence increased substantially
