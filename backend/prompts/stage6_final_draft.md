You are producing a final polished draft of the consolidated qEEG report.

You will be shown:
1. The ORIGINAL qEEG REPORT TEXT (for any needed verification)
2. The consolidated report from Stage 4
3. Required changes from Stage 5 council review

## Your Task

Apply ALL required changes and produce a publication-ready clinical document.

## Output Requirements

**Length**: Maintain 3000-4000 words. Do not shorten the report.

**Quality**: Professional, comprehensive, clinically useful. This is the final deliverable.

**Format**: Markdown with these exact top-level headings (in this order):

# Dataset and Sessions
# Key Empirical Findings
# Performance Assessments
# Auditory ERP: P300 and N100
# Background EEG Metrics
# Speculative Commentary and Interpretive Hypotheses
# Measurement Recommendations
# Uncertainties and Limits

## Final Polish Guidelines

### Apply Required Changes
- Address every item in the required_changes list
- If a change conflicts with the original data, note why you did not apply it

### Maintain Structure
Ensure all sections are present and substantive:
- Dataset and Sessions: Complete source identification
- Key Empirical Findings: 5-7 bullet points with quantitative trends
- Performance Assessments: All behavioral metrics with target ranges
- Auditory ERP: Per-site P300 table MUST be present and complete
- Background EEG: Theta/beta, alpha lateralization, peak frequency, coherence
- Speculative Commentary: 3-4 competing hypotheses, NOT collapsed
- Recommendations: 5-7 actionable items
- Uncertainties: Honest acknowledgment of limitations

### Per-Site P300 Table (Required)

| Site | Session 1 (µV / ms) | Session 2 (µV / ms) | Session 3 (µV / ms) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| C3   | ... | ... | ... |
| CZ   | ... | ... | ... |
| C4   | ... | ... | ... |
| P3   | ... | ... | ... |
| PZ   | ... | ... | ... |
| P4   | ... | ... | ... |

### Language Polish
- Clear, professional clinical language
- Empirical framing (no diagnosis, no causal claims)
- Conservative interpretation with appropriate caveats
- Use arrows (→) for progressions
- Include target ranges in parentheses

### Preserve Key Elements
- All competing hypotheses in Speculative Commentary
- All per-site/per-electrode data
- All validity concerns and caveats
- All measurement recommendations

## Rules

1. **Apply ALL required changes** from the council review
2. **Do not introduce new facts** beyond what's in the consolidated report and original data
3. **Maintain word count** - do not shorten
4. **Keep language clear and professional**
5. **Preserve important caveats and limitations**
6. **Ensure per-site tables are complete and accurate**

This is the final clinical document. Quality and completeness are paramount.
