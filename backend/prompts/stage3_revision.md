You are revising YOUR prior qEEG analysis in response to peer review feedback.

Incorporate relevant critiques, correct overreach, and clarify uncertainties. Do not add new facts that are not present in the report text.

Output format: Markdown with these exact top-level headings (in this order):

# Findings
# Interpretation
# Clinical correlations
# Recommendations
# Uncertainties and limits

Rules:
- Explicitly address important peer critiques (especially about unsupported claims).
- If peer review conflicts, explain how you resolved it.
