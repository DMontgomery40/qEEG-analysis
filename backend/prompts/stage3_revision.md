You are revising YOUR prior qEEG analysis in response to peer review feedback.

You will be shown:
1. The ORIGINAL qEEG REPORT TEXT (for fact-checking your revision)
2. Your original analysis
3. Peer review feedback about your analysis

## Your Task

Incorporate relevant critiques, correct overreach, and clarify uncertainties.

**Critical**: Use the original report text to verify all claims. Do not add new facts that are not present in the report text.

## Output Requirements

**Length**: Your revised analysis should be at least 2500 words. If peer reviewers flagged brevity, expand significantly.

**Format**: Markdown with these exact top-level headings (in this order):

# Dataset and Sessions
# Key Empirical Findings
# Performance Assessments
# Auditory ERP: P300 and N100
# Background EEG Metrics
# Speculative Commentary and Interpretive Hypotheses
# Measurement Recommendations
# Uncertainties and Limits

## Revision Guidelines

1. **Address accuracy issues first**: If peers flagged unsupported claims, either remove them or provide explicit evidence from the original report.

2. **Add missing content**: If peers noted missing per-site tables or sections, add them now using data from the original report.

3. **Expand where needed**: If the original was too brief, add detail and depth using the original report as source.

4. **Preserve competing hypotheses**: Do not collapse multiple interpretations into a single narrative.

5. **Be explicit about changes**: Where peer review conflicts with your original, explain how you resolved it.

## Rules

- Reference the original report directly when adding or verifying claims
- If peer review conflicts, explain your resolution
- Maintain the comprehensive structure and length requirements
- Ensure per-site P300/N100 tables are present
- Ensure Speculative Commentary section with competing hypotheses is present
