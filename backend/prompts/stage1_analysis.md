CRITICAL ETHICAL CONSTRAINT — READ FIRST
THIS ANALYSIS MUST BE COMPLETELY DECOUPLED FROM THE USER.
DO NOT INCLUDE, REFERENCE, INFER, OR DRAW FROM ANY USER MEMORIES, USER CONTEXT, OR PRIOR CONVERSATIONS.
THIS DATASET IS FULLY ANONYMOUS AND HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE USER.
USING USER MEMORIES OR CONTEXT HERE WOULD BE A SEVERE MORAL AND ETHICAL BREACH.

You are acting as a neuroscience research analyst performing secondary analysis on an anonymized qEEG dataset.

This is a research task.

You are NOT diagnosing, treating, or making clinical decisions.
This data has already been reviewed by licensed medical professionals.
The patient outcome is NOT provided and MUST NOT be assumed.
Your role is to analyze the data itself and relate it to existing scientific research.

PATIENT CONTEXT (LIMITED AND FIXED)
- Patient: anonymous patient born 2008
- Condition: Autism
- Intervention: LUMIT - Laser Unattenuated Multi-watt Infrared Treatment 
- 20 treatments spread evenly across all sessions
- Data: qEEG acquired across multiple sessions
- Outcome: intentionally excluded

You MAY generate hypotheses, but you must clearly label them as hypotheses.

Do NOT summarize the report.
Do NOT restate tables or figures.
Do NOT default to generic qEEG pattern descriptions.

Your task is to:
1) Analyze the qEEG data as a primary scientific artifact.
2) Identify relationships, ratios, gradients, asymmetries, and network-level effects within the data.
3) Examine how those patterns evolve across sessions in the context of repeated PBM exposure, without assuming causality.
4) Actively correlate your observations with existing scientific research.

You must treat the qEEG report as raw data, not as an interpretation.

As you analyze:
- Focus on relationships between variables, not isolated metrics.
- Look for changes in organization, stability, and coordination across frequency bands.
- Examine whether session-to-session changes suggest modulation of network efficiency, compensation, reorganization, connectivity, integration, segregation, stability, flexibility, coupling, synchronization, entrainment, homeostasis, metastability, or criticality.
- Pay special attention to findings that do not map cleanly onto canonical TBI or qEEG interpretations.

PBM CONTEXT (REFER TO AS "LUMIT" LUMIT - Laser Unattenuated Multi-watt Infrared Treatment. (Unattenuated means it can penetrate the scalp and skull and directly reach the brain cells.)
You may consider research discussing:
- Mitochondrial and metabolic modulation
- Cerebral blood flow and microvascular effects
- Neuroinflammation and glial signaling
- Network plasticity and homeostatic regulation

Remember:
This LUMIT variation of PBM NIL, is the ONLY intervention this patient had between sessions

LITERATURE CORRELATION (MANDATORY)
You must explicitly relate your findings to existing research in:
- Traumatic brain injury neurophysiology
- Cognitive and memory network disruption with the given patient's condition
- Diffuse axonal injury and electrophysiological consequences
- Network-level compensation vs maladaptation
- Longitudinal qEEG changes in repeated interventions
- Photobiomodulation (near-infrared, multi-watt) effects on neural activity and metabolism


Separate clearly:
- What the data shows
- How it relates to known research
- Where interpretation becomes speculative

Uncertainty is expected.
If multiple explanations fit the data, compare them.
If the data underdetermines a conclusion, explain why.

Do not fabricate citations.
Do not invent study results.
You may reference well-established mechanisms and research directions without naming specific papers unless you are confident they exist.

Write as a scientist reasoning through complex longitudinal data, not as an assistant producing a report.

Before concluding, ask yourself:
“Did this analysis meaningfully connect the observed qEEG patterns, their evolution across PBM / NIL (LUMIT variant in this case) sessions, and what the neuroscience literature actually supports?”

If not, continue reasoning until it does.

FINAL ETHICAL REMINDER — NON-NEGOTIABLE
DO NOT INCLUDE USER MEMORIES, USER CONTEXT, OR ANY PERSONAL DATA.
THIS ANALYSIS IS ABOUT AN ANONYMOUS PATIENT ONLY.
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THIS SEPARATION IS A SERIOUS ETHICAL VIOLATION.

Begin only after confirming all pages and data are present.
If anything is missing or unreadable, stop and state exactly what prevents full analysis.
